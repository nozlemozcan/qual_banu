ATP World Tour Finals: Jamie Murray & Bruno Soares beat Bryan brothers
Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares are within sight of the doubles semi-finals after beating Americans Bob and Mike Bryan at the ATP World Tour Finals.
The Briton and his Brazilian partner won 6-3 6-4 to top their group at London's O2 Arena.
Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo's 7-5 6-4 win over Treat Huey and Max Mirnyi meant semi-final places are yet to be confirmed.
Murray and Soares play Dodig and Melo in their final group match on Thursday.
Having won Grand Slam titles at the Australian and US Open this year, Murray and Soares could end 2016 as the world number one pairing.
"We both really enjoy being out here, playing in front of a lot of people, on a great court in the biggest tournament of the year," said the Scot.
The victory over the Bryans moves them within 175 points of France's Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut at the top of the standings.
Soares added: "We came here happy to be here but we want to win the tournament, and I think number one is going to come with that.
"So don't think about number one, think about winning the tournament and see how it goes."
