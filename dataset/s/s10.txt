Lorena Ochoa Invitational: England's Ewart Shadoff second in Mexico City
England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff finished joint second, two shots behind winner Carlota Ciganda, at the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Mexico City.
Ewart Shadoff, 28, hit a final-round 67, ending the tournament on 11 under for her best result of the year.
She tied for second with overnight leader Austin Ernst, Angela Stanford, Karine Icher and Sarah Jane Smith.
Spain's Ciganda, 26, was one shot off the pace heading into the final day, but a round of 68 clinched the win.
Her round included four birdies, an eagle and two bogeys and her victory comes four weeks after she won her maiden LPGA title in South Korea.
The tournament at Club de Golf Mexico is the penultimate event of a season that concludes next week with the Tour Championship in Naples, Florida.
